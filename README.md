# TodoList

TodoList is a JavaFX app for saving and organising things to be done in a simple way.

## Installation

If you already develop applications with JavaFX, you probably don't need to download anything at all, otherwise you have to install JavaFX when working with Java 11 or higher (it is not the part of JDK since Java 11).
